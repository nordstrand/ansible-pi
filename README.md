Ansible playbooks for Raspberry Pi:s running Raspbian

The focus are on Pi:s running as head-less servers, for these applications a large number of the Raspbian default
packages can be pruned thus saving space on the SD card and perhaps also even promoting SD card longetivity. The wear
leveling performed by SD card controller may be able to do a better job when there is much free space on the card. Due
to this reason I typically never expand the size of the default Raspbian file system.
